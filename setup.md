# Setup Java, Netbeans etc.

## NetBeans

Install [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)

## Git

Git is included in Netbeans. Assuming you already have a Github account, see the [Netbeans Git Support](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html) for setup instructions, or ask Steve to see his setup.

## UML

[EasyUML](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/55435/easyuml) is a plugin that allows you to draw UML diagrams (e.g. class diagrams) and then generate Java code from it. If EasyUML is not in the Netbeans Plugin Update Centre, then you can download it, unzip it, then add all the included plugins (the .nbm files).

For an example of use see this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME_S7gPnVI)
