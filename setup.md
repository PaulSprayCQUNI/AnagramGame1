# Setup Java, Netbeans etc.

## NetBeans

Install [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)

## Git

Git is included in Netbeans. Assuming you already have a Github account, see the [Netbeans Git Support](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html) for setup instructions, or ask Steve to see his setup. The basic steps are:

1. Team -> Git -> Clone ...
2. Repository: https://github.com/steve-cqu/oop.git
3. Clone into: C:\Users\you\git
4. The above steps will pull (download) all files from the shared OOP repo into your hard drive in the git directory
5. Now you can open projects/code

Then during working you:

1. Add new files/projects (performed locally on your computer)
2. Commit those files (local)
3. Push those files to the Github repo (uploads)

Also before you start working you should Pull (download) files from the Github repo



## UML

[EasyUML](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/55435/easyuml) is a plugin that allows you to draw UML diagrams (e.g. class diagrams) and then generate Java code from it. If EasyUML is not in the Netbeans Plugin Update Centre, then you can download it, unzip it, then add all the included plugins (the .nbm files).

For an example of use see this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QME_S7gPnVI)
